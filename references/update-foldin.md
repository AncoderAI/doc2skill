## Update / Fold-in Workflow

When performing an Update/Fold-in operation on an existing skill at `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/`:

### 1. Read Existing Skill Structure
Read and parse the existing skill's files:
- Read `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/SKILL.md` to parse the existing **Chapter Index**, **Topic Index**, metadata (author, total chapters), and **Core Frameworks**.
- List all files in `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/chapters/` to find the highest chapter number (e.g. `ch12`).
- Read `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/glossary.md`, `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/patterns.md`, and `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/cheatsheet.md` to see what terms and frameworks are already indexed.

### 2. Match Content & Identify Revisions vs. Additions
Analyze the new extracted text in `<tempdir>/book_skill_work/full_text.txt` to identify if the new content represents:
- **Updates/Revisions to existing chapters**: If a section of the new content directly updates or expands an existing chapter's topic, read the existing chapter file, merge the new details into it, and rewrite the file.
- **New additions**: If the content introduces new chapters, papers, or separate sections, create **new chapter summary files** under `chapters/`. Start numbering these files after the highest existing chapter number (e.g. if the existing chapters stop at `ch12`, create `ch13-*.md`, `ch14-*.md`, etc.).

### 3. Generate or Update Chapter Summary Files
For each new or revised chapter:
- Read the corresponding section of the extracted new text.
- Follow the formatting guidelines in **Step 7** to build the summary.
- Write/update the file in `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/chapters/`.

### 4. Merge Supporting Files
- **Merge glossary.md**:
  - Read the existing `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/glossary.md`.
  - Extract all new terms and definitions from the new content (Step 8 glossary guidelines).
  - Combine and alphabetize the list of existing and new terms.
  - If a term already exists, append the new chapter/source references to it (e.g. `**Term** — definition (Ch 4, Ch 13)`).
  - Rewrite `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/glossary.md` with the fully merged, alphabetized list.
- **Merge patterns.md**:
  - Read existing `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/patterns.md`.
  - Extract any new techniques, algorithms, or patterns from the new content.
  - Append the new patterns, ensuring consistent formatting, and keeping the total length concise (under 2,500 tokens).
- **Merge cheatsheet.md**:
  - Read existing `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/cheatsheet.md`.
  - Extract new comparison rules, decision tables, or parameter guides.
  - Integrate them cleanly into the cheatsheet structure.

### 5. Re-generate the Master SKILL.md
Update the master skill file `$SKILLS_HOME/<skill_name>/SKILL.md`:
- **Metadata**: Increment the chapter count, update the estimated page count, and add the new source names if appropriate. Update the `Generated` date to the current date.
- **Core Frameworks**: Fold in the most high-impact mental models or principles from the new content (ensuring the overall file remains under 4,000 tokens).
- **Chapter Index**: Append the new chapters to the index table, linking to the newly created files.
- **Topic Index**: Merge the new topics alphabetically. If an existing topic is also covered in the new chapters, append the new chapter links to its line (e.g. `- **Topic** → ch05, ch13`).

### 6. Scan, Cleanup, and Report
Once the files are successfully written and merged, run **Step 9.5**, then proceed to **Step 10** to perform cleanup and print a custom update report summarizing the newly added chapters, merged glossary terms, and updated indices.
